# MongoDB Transaction Fix for Standalone Instances

## Problem
The application was encountering the error:
```
MongoServerError: Transaction numbers are only allowed on a replica set member or mongos
```

This error occurs when Mongoose tries to use transactions on a standalone MongoDB instance, which doesn't support transactions.

## Root Cause
- Mongoose 8.x automatically tries to use sessions and transactions for certain operations
- The database connection was not explicitly configured for standalone mode
- Some database operations were implicitly creating transaction contexts

## Solution Applied

### 1. Database Connection Updates (`db.js`)
- Added explicit options to disable transactions and sessions
- Set `retryWrites: false` to prevent automatic retry logic
- Set `directConnection: true` to force standalone mode
- Disabled replica set discovery and related features
- Added connection string sanitization to remove replica set parameters

### 2. Database Operations Updates
Updated all `findByIdAndUpdate` operations to explicitly disable transactions:
- Added `session: null` to prevent session creation
- Added `writeConcern: { w: 1 }` for simple write operations
- Applied to `processVideo.js` and `uploadRoute.js`

### 3. Mongoose Configuration
- Set `mongoose.set('strictQuery', false)` to prevent strict query behavior
- Disabled automatic retry logic with `retryReads: false`

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
You need to set the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable in your `.env` file:

```bash
# For local MongoDB
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/clipsmart

# For MongoDB Atlas (cloud hosted)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/clipsmart

# For MongoDB with authentication
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://username:password@localhost:27017/clipsmart
```

### Creating .env File
1. Create a `.env` file in your project root directory
2. Add the MongoDB connection string and other required variables
3. Make sure the file is not committed to version control (add to .gitignore)

## Files Modified
- `backend/db.js` - Database connection configuration
- `backend/controllers/videosController/processVideo.js` - Video processing operations
- `backend/routes/uploadRoute.js` - Upload route operations

## Testing
Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
cd backend
node test-db-connection.js
```

## Expected Behavior
- Database operations should complete without transaction errors
- Video processing should work correctly on standalone MongoDB
- No more "Transaction numbers are only allowed on a replica set member or mongos" errors

## Notes
- This fix is specifically for standalone MongoDB instances
- If you later upgrade to a replica set, you may need to remove some of these restrictions
- The application will now use simple write operations without transaction guarantees
